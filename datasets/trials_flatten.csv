*** NOTE: The content and format of these specific notifications for the Outside Assay process will vary depending on the designated outside lab in question, as they are each responsible for their own outreach efforts; it is strongly recommended that the designated outside laboratory be contacted to confirm the format and receipt of this notification prior to registering any patients to Step 0
** Patients with an applicable “rare variant” must be able to meet the eligibility criteria for the appropriate subprotocols within 4 weeks following notification of treatment assignment
*** NOTE: The receipt of this notification (and the start of the associated deadline for Step 1 registration) may occur shortly after Step 0 registration, since these patients will not be submitting tissue for screening purposes; however, for certain “rare variant” arms, submission of archival tissue for central immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing may be required
** Registration to Step 0 must occur after stopping prior systemic anti-cancer therapy; there is no specific duration for which patients must be off treatment prior to registration to Step 0, as long as all eligibility criteria are met
** There is no particular window of time after notification of potential eligibility from an outside lab in which the patient must be registered to Step 0, but treatment slots will be assigned on a first come, first serve basis to those who do register to Step 0, and are not held for those notified of potential eligibility who do not register to Step 0
** Patients may have received other non-targeted, immunotherapy or targeted treatment between the prior genetic testing at the outside lab and registration to Step 0; the decision to stop such treatment in favor of participation in MATCH, if no further clinical benefit is expected, is per the treating physician's discretion; documentation of a lack of response to the prior treatment is not required in these cases
*** NOTE: Other potential aMOIs that would be eligibility criteria for “NON RARE” arms, as determined by the designated laboratories, are not applicable for this process in MATCH
*** NOTE: Tumor tissue for the confirmation of “rare variant” by the MATCH assay is to be submitted, preferably from the same time of collection as that evaluated by the designated outside laboratory",Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 1 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months,"Patients must be able to swallow tablets or capsules; a patient with any gastrointestinal disease that would impair ability to swallow, retain, or absorb drug is not eligible","Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive are eligible if:
